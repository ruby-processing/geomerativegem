### Text Along a Geomerative Path

To use the `RCommand` constant `UNIFORMLENGTH` in JRubyArt (and java constants in general with jruby) you would normally need to address it in the following way:- `Java::Generative::RCommand::UNIFORMLENGTH`. However in the geomerative gem we have done `package_include 'geomerative'` for you so you can get away with the short form `RCommand::UNIFORMLENGTH`, but you do need the `RCommand::` prefix. For processing constants the full form for the `RIGHT` constant would be `Java::ProcessingCore::PConstants::RIGHT` but because we hate typing we have made the processing constant `RIGHT` available without the `PConstants::` prefix. If you have namespace difficulties you can always fall back on the full forms.

# Very quickly thrown together code whilst learning how the
# geomerative library ticks.
#
# Here we take out previous scripts drawing and placing points along an arc and
# complete our initial idea of placing text along the arc.
